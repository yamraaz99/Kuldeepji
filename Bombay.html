<li class="c">The site chosen for the institute was <b>Powai</b> with an area of <b>550 acres (2.2 km2) </b> which was given by the then <b>Bombay State Government.</b></li><br>
<li class="d">While construction was being completed, the <b>first academic session of the Institute opened on 25 July 1958,</b> in its temporary home at the <b>Synthetic and Art Silk Mills Research Association (SASMIRA) </b> building in Worli with <b>100 students.</b></li><br>
<li class="e">he following is the present position regarding the assistance received from UNESCO under the UN Expanded Programme of Technical Assistance.</li><br>
<li class="f"><b>Equipment costing Rs.57,35,000 has so far been received (USSR Rs.55,50,000; UK Rs.1,50,000; USA Rs.18,000 and Germany Rs.19,000)</b></li><br>
<li class="g">12 Progressors (10 Russians, 1 American and 1 Yugoslavian) and 3 Russians Translators are working at the Institution.</li><br>
<li class="a">For advanced training in USSR, 4 Indian teachers were deputed in 1958 and 6 more teachers was selected.</li><br>
<li class="b">These students were selected from over <b>3,400 applicants </b> for admission to the first year undergraduate engineering programmes of <b>Aerospace, Chemical, Civil, Computer, Electrical, Engineering Physics, Energy, Mechanical, Metallurgical Engineering, and MSc Chemistry.</b></li><br>
<li class="c">One of the main objectives of establishing the institute was to develop facilities for studies in a variety of specialized engineering and technological sciences.</li><br>
<li class="d">He need for establishing adequate facilities for postgraduate studies and research was kept uppermost in mind in the founding years.</li><br>
<li class="e">While the institute was functioning provisionally at Worli, an effort was made to expedite the progress of the building project at its permanent location and <b>Jawaharlal Nehru laid the foundation stone of the Institute at Powai on 10 March 1959.</b></li><br>
