                        <p class="mb-4">The nineteenth century marked a significant period in global economic history. It saw the rise of the modern industrial economy and the establishment of a complex global network of trade, labor, and capital.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">By the 1890s, a global agricultural economy had taken shape. Now food no longer came from a nearby village or town, but from far away places. For example, countries like Eastern Europe, Russia, America, and Australia began to export wheat, while meat came from New Zealand and Argentina. Britain began to import food products from abroad and cut food production at home.</p>

                            <p>This shift in Britain was made possible by the rapid and cheap transportation of food grains. The introduction of refrigerated ships also enabled distant countries to export perishable items like meat, butter, and eggs. Additionally, Britain had abolished the <span class="key-term">Corn Laws</span> in 1846, removing tariff protection for agriculture, which made it more economical to import food than to produce it domestically.</p>

                    <p>In the 1890s, a fast-spreading disease of cattle, the rinderpest (also known as the cattle plague), arrived in Africa. It was carried by infected cattle imported from British Asia to feed the Italian soldiers invading Eritrea in East Africa. The disease spread like wildfire in Africa and killed 90% of the cattle.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">The loss of cattle destroyed African livelihoods. Planters, mine owners, and colonial governments took advantage of the situation to push Africans into the labor market. Control over the scarce resource of cattle enabled Europeans to colonize Africa.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">In the nineteenth century, thousands of Indian and Chinese laborers went to work on plantations, in mines, and in road and railway construction projects around the world.</p>

                        <p class="mb-4">In India, indentured laborers were hired under contracts which promised return passage to India after they had worked for five years on plantations. Most indentured workers came from the present-day regions of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, central India, and the dry districts of Tamil Nadu.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4">Numerous factors led to this migration. In the mid-nineteenth century, these regions experienced many social and economic changes – cottage industries declined, land rents rose, lands were cleared for mines and plantations, and increasingly peasants found it difficult to pay their revenue.</p>
                        
                        <p class="mb-4">Agents (or recruiters) were paid a small commission by the employers, and they used all kinds of methods to recruit laborers. Many migrants agreed to take up work hoping to escape poverty or oppression in their home villages. While some went in search of work willingly, others were forcibly recruited.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">The Great Depression began around 1929 and lasted till the mid-1930s. During this period, most parts of the world experienced catastrophic declines in production, employment, incomes, and trade.</p>

                            <li>Agricultural overproduction remained a problem, leading to a fall in agricultural prices and rural incomes</li>
                            <li>Many US banks had lent large amounts to European countries during and after the war, and as these countries struggled to repay, the banks were on the verge of collapse</li>
                            <li>The withdrawal of US loans affected the economies of the borrowing countries</li>
                            <li>In the USA itself, as unemployment soared, purchasing power declined, leading to a fall in demand and further unemployment</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The US attempt to protect its economy through high tariffs (the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariff of 1930) worsened the situation. Other industrial countries also raised their tariffs in retaliation. This led to a drastic decline in world trade.</p>

                        <p>The depression immediately affected Indian trade. India's exports and imports nearly halved between 1928 and 1934. Agriculture prices fell sharply, but the colonial government refused to reduce revenue demands. Peasants and farmers suffered more than urban dwellers. Though agricultural prices fell sharply, the prices of manufactured goods didn't decline as much, so the countryside suffered a greater decline in purchasing power.</p>
                        <p class="mt-3">Interestingly, British industries were hit badly by the Depression. But British imports into India declined less sharply than imports from other countries. This was because of Britain's colonial relationship with India, which allowed them to safeguard their economic interests at the expense of the colony.</p>

                <p class="mb-4">India's own position in the post-war world economy was complex. As a newly independent country in 1947, India had to decide how to engage with the international economic order.</p>

                    <p>India adopted a mixed economic strategy after independence. While engaging with international trade and seeking foreign investment in certain sectors, it also followed a policy of self-reliance and import substitution industrialization. This approach sought to build domestic industrial capacity while limiting dependence on foreign goods and capital.</p>
                    <p class="mt-3">India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, along with statistician P.C. Mahalanobis, formulated a strategy focused on developing heavy industries, which was reflected in India's five-year plans. However, India's share in world trade declined in the decades after independence, and the country faced persistent balance of payments problems.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p class="mb-4">In the 1990s, following a serious economic crisis, India began liberalizing its economy, reducing barriers to trade and investment, and integrating more closely with the global economy. This marked a shift away from the earlier policy of self-reliance towards greater participation in globalization.</p>

                    <p>The most recent phase of globalization, beginning from around the 1970s, was made possible largely due to the development of information and communication technologies (ICT) like satellite communication, the Internet, and global mobile networking. These technologies compressed time and space, facilitating almost real-time financial transactions and coordination of production across countries.</p>

                            <p class="mb-4">Henry Ford was an American industrialist who revolutionized manufacturing through the development of the assembly line technique of mass production. His innovations transformed not just the automobile industry but the entire concept of industrial production.</p>

                                <li>Founded the Ford Motor Company in 1903</li>
                                <li>Introduced the Model T in 1908, the first affordable automobile for the middle class</li>
                                <li>Pioneered the moving assembly line in 1913, dramatically reducing production time and costs</li>
                                <li>Introduced the $5 per day wage in 1914, more than doubling the average factory wage</li>
                                <li>Created the concept of vertical integration, controlling raw materials through to final product</li>

                            <p>Ford's assembly line method involved moving the car on a conveyor belt, with each worker repeatedly performing a single task. This increased efficiency dramatically - the time to build a car fell from over 12 hours to just 93 minutes.</p>

                        <p><strong>Global Significance:</strong> Ford's mass production techniques enabled the rise of mass consumption. Higher wages meant workers could afford to buy the products they made, creating a virtuous cycle of production and consumption. This "Fordist" model became the basis for economic growth in many industrialized countries and shaped global manufacturing practices throughout the 20th century.</p>

                            <p>At Bretton Woods, Keynes proposed a more balanced international monetary system than what was ultimately adopted. While his proposal for a global currency ("bancor") was rejected in favor of a dollar-based system, he did help shape the IMF and World Bank, institutions that remain central to the global economy.</p>

                        <p><strong>Global Significance:</strong> Keynes's ideas provided the theoretical foundation for the mixed economies that characterized the post-war period in Western countries. His emphasis on maintaining aggregate demand through government spending during downturns became orthodox policy for decades. The Bretton Woods institutions he helped design created a framework for international economic cooperation that, though modified, continues to shape global economic governance today.</p>
